## Faking a Twitter feed
Now that we're familiar with Basscss, it's time to kick things up a notch and use it to fake a Twitter feed. Don't
worry, we're still keeping things relatively basic. Here's what your end result should look like:

A couple of pointers:

- The feed is contained in a `div` that is 600px wide, and centered horizontally. **Do this using Flexbox for
practice!** Note that it also has some top margin to make the feed not stick to the page.
- Feel free to use any content you want
- All tweets have a bottom line to separate them a little, apart from the last tweet.
- Keep an eye on the whitespace: between the image and the text on the right, between the tweet and the separator, ...
- Lastly, add a custom class called `muted` (you can do this in the `<head>` of the HTML using the `<style>` tag). This
class gives text a font color of `#999`. Apply this to the Twitter handle and date timestamp as shown in the screenshot.
